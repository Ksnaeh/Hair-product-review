A review website developed in MEAN stack during the course of my study in Temasek Polytechnic. Originally catered Node.JS and Express to run on "Web Server for Chrome" hosting app, however due to the end of support of the hosting app, it has been revised to locally run on the deivce. 

Frontend is developed using Angular 7 Typescript. Database used is MongoDB.
